Adapted Chor-js (https://github.com/bptlab/chor-js) which is licensed under the MIT License (https://github.com/bptlab/chor-js/blob/master/LICENSE). Only minor adaptions were needed, because Importer from chor-js is not adaptable via plugin. If this is changed in the future, this adapted version becomes obsolete and changes can be done directly within the SitScopePlugin (https://github.com/domasm92/SitScopePlugin).
